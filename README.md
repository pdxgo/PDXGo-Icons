[Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.com/) created the original gopher which has been edited many times to create the current PDX logo.  All credit for the cute gopher iconography goes to Renee!  

Golang wrote a [blog post](http://blog.golang.org/gopher) which covers the entire history of the Gopher.
