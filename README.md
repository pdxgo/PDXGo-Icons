PDXGo-Icons ===========

Assets for creating the current PDXGo icon used on Twitter and Meetup.  Feel free to use assets extraced from the incredibly cute gopher for your own iconography/memos/etc!

##Credit where credit is due!
[Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.com/) created the original gopher which has been edited many times to create the current PDX logo.  All credit for the cute gopher iconography goes to Renee!  

Golang wrote a [blog post](http://blog.golang.org/gopher) which covers the entire history of the Gopher.
